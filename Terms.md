# Intro
SystemUI Tuner is a replacement and extension of AOSP's included System UI Tuner.

With SystemUI Tuner you can, among other things:
 - Hide status bar icons
 - Enable system-wide Immersive Mode and tweak its behavior per-app
 - Modify the behavior and appearance of the Quick Settings shade
 - Enable and customize Demo Mode
 - Change system-wide animation speeds
 - Enter and read your own custom settings values
 
# User Support
I make no guarantee with this app that:
 - it will work on your particular device
 - it will not cause your device to malfunction
 - every feature will work on your device

SystemUI Tuner has no warranty. If you choose to use this app, I am not responsible for anything that goes wrong.
I will do my best to help you provided that:
 - I can
 - you have read this document and its warnings
 - you don't ask a question already answered here
 
# Permissions
SystemUI Tuner asks for some sensitive permissions:
 - android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
 - android.permission.DUMP
 - android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS
 
These permissions are not used to collect any sort of data, cause harm to your device (except by your own volition), or for any other malicious intent. SystemUI Tuner is open source (you are currently on the source page), and you are welcome to verify the validity of this claim.

Below I have explained the reason(s) each permission is needed:

WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
 - Without this, SystemUI Tuner just won't work. Hiding status bar icons, modifying Immersive Mode, changing Quick Settings, etc, all need this permission to function.

DUMP
 - This permission is needed for Demo Mode to function.
 - This permission is needed for the Status Bar icon auto-detect feature.
 
PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS
 - This permission is needed for the Status Bar icon auto-detect feature.
 
I have attempted to modularize when these permissions are requested. All three are requested during setup, but *only* WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS is required at this point. If you skip the other permissions at this time, they will be requested when you attempt to use a function that requires them.

While each of these permissions requires a special process to grant them, they are no different from permissions such as CAMERA or MICROPHONE. That is, as soon as you uninstall SystemUI Tuner or clear its data, these permissions are revoked by Android.

# Uninstallation/Reset
SystemUI Tuner has absolutely no way to detect when you uninstall it. SystemUI Tuner also has no way to know what the settings on your device originally were. This means a few things:
 - if you uninstall SystemUI Tuner, none of your settings will be reverted or undone.
 - there is no "Reset to Defaults" option in SystemUI Tuner, nor can there be.
 
It is up to you to remember what you have modified while using SystemUI Tuner. If you decide to uninstall it or you want to go back to default settings, you have to do that yourself. It is simply impossible for SystemUI Tuner to work out what your default settings were.
 
# Safety/Warnings
As mentioned in the introduction, I take no responsibility if you break your device. That said, I will lay out some warnings below, to supplement the many, _many_, **many** already present in the app:
 
TouchWiz might break while using this app. See the TouchWiz section for details.

This app modifies system settings, and gives you the power to break your device. Use caution and only use this app if you are comfortable with manual recovery.

Immersive Mode is a **system** function. I did not make it and I do not control it. If problems arise through usage, **THIS IS THE FAULT OF YOUR MANUFACTURER*.

# Limitations
Since this app is **not** a system app, and does **not** have full system access, it has quite a few limitations.
 - This is **not** a theming app, nor is it meant to be! It cannot change the position, color or size of any system elements.
 - Some things simply will **not** function on your device! If certain status bar icon toggles have no effect, or Demo Mode does not function, there is absolutely nothing I can do.
 - SystemUI Tuner simply modifies system settings. It is not a "magic wand" that can do anything without root.

Explicit list of examples of functions SystemUI Tuner cannot do:
 - Move the clock
 - Fix icon toggles that have no effect
 - Remove the carrier label (except on TouchWiz Oreo and above)
 - Add custom Quick Settings on Marshmallow devices that are more advanced than a simple broadcast
 - Change the color of status bar icons, Quick Settings, etc

Explicit list of examples of functions SystemUI Tuner cannot do on all devices:
 - Remove the dual-SIM icon
 - Remove the VoLTE icon
 - Modify the Quick Settings row and column counts
 - Modify the QS header count
 - Auto detect which status bar icons to hide
 - Hide any status bar icons
 - Enable Demo Mode
 - Change lockscreen shortcuts
 - Enable clock seconds
 - Enable in-battery percentage
 - Enable Night Mode/Display
 - etc
 
Neither list is exhaustive. The point is that SystemUI Tuner **CANNOT** do everything. If you email me asking (or demanding) that I "fix" something that does not work, I will simply ignore it.
 
# TouchWiz
TouchWiz is weird:
  - SystemUI Tuner **WILL NOT WORK** on TouchWiz Marshmallow.
  - Modifying status bar icons may cause crashes on TouchWiz Nougat.
  - The Rotation Lock icon may appear when modifying status bar icons. **READ THE WARNING IN THE APP TO LEARN HOW TO FIX THIS**
  
Since TouchWiz is so heavily modified from AOSP, this is simply how things are.
 
# MIUI
**DO NOT EXPECT THAT SYSTEMUI TUNER WILL WORK ON MIUI**
You may get lucky with a version where at least some functions work, but there is absolutely no guarantee, nor is there anything I can do about it.

# EMUI
EMUI Oreo and Pie have had decreasing compatibility with SystemUI Tuner. As with MIUI, this is out of my control.
